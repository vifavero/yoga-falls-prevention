              The key to making your body fall-proof is strengthening those specific muscles that are responsible for keeping you on your feet, while simultaneously loosening the specific joints that improve your mobility. You also need to challenge your sensory system to train your brain to react quickly when your balance is challenged.

                The sensory system detects when a person is losing balance. [ This includes ] receptors in muscles and joints that sense motion and pressure sensors in the soles of the feet. All those sensory elements have to work properly for the brain to detect a loss of balance. And when it does, it must process that information quickly to tell the muscles to stabilize the body by taking a step or grabbing an object for support.
