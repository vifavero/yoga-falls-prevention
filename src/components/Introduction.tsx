                I lived a healthy lifestyle. I Exercise regularly. I am not overweight. I honestly never worried about the dangers of falling.. UNTIL I FELL.

            It was a day like any other. The weather was good. I was feeling great. I met some friends for brunch and picked up a few groceries.

              I was walking to my car... and my shoe caught on a small crack in the parking lot. I immediately lost my balance and could not regain my stability. My bag went flying and I went down - HARD. My worst nightmare was happening. It felt like everything was happening in slow motion - and yet it truly was all over in the blink of an eye. One moment I was thinking about what I should make for dinner that night - and the next moment my body - and my world - came crashing down HARD. The pain was overwhelming and the shock was paralyzing.

                A small crowd had gathered around me - some helping to gather my scattered groceries, others trying to help me to my feet, and others offering to call for medical help.
